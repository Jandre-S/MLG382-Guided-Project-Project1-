# Point 3: Data Understanding
- Gathering initial data and exploring its characteristics.
- Assessing data quality, completeness, and relevance.
- Identifying potential data issues and limitations.

## Goals:
- Understand the data and its characteristics.
- Identify data quality issues and potential problems.
- Determine the feasibility of the project.

## Activities:
- Review data documentation and metadata.
- Examine data summaries and visualizations.
- Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Deliverables:
- Data report summarizing findings and insights.
- Data visualizations and summaries.
- Initial data cleaning and preprocessing scripts.
- Recommendations for data quality improvement.

## Some key tasks involved in the data understanding phase include:
- Data Review: Reviewing data documentation, metadata, and data dictionaries to understand the data's context, format, and content.
- Data Summarization: Calculating summary statistics, such as means, medians, modes, and standard deviations, to understand the distribution of data.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations, such as plots, charts, and heatmaps, to understand the relationships and patternsin the data.
- Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuraciesiin the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical and ML techniques to explore the data and identify relationships, patterns, and correlations.
- Data Quality Assessment: Evaluating the quality of the data and identifying potential issues, such as missing values, outliers, and incosistencies.
